Screenshots

Fix the broken code to implement the following three features:

When opened, the app should display a list of abbreviations of U.S. states:
![List of states](./screenshots/screen1.png =300x)
Clicking on a state abbreviation should take the user to a page that displays that state's position in the list:
![State view](./screenshots/screen2.png =300x)
3. Clicking the red "delete" button on the main screen should erase the entire list of abbreviations.
![Erase button](./screenshots/screen3.png =300x)
